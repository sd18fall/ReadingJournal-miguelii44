    "This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to find, errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named `Kangaroo` with the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. An `__init__` method that initializes an attribute named `pouch_contents` to an empty list.\n",
    " 2. A method named `put_in_pouch` that takes an object of any type and adds it to `pouch_contents`.\n",
    " 3. A `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the `Kangaroo` object and the contents of the pouch.\n",
